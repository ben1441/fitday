- Primary color: Strong blue (#3498db) for a sense of trust and competence. 
- Background color: Very light gray (#ecf0f1) for a clean, uncluttered feel.
- Accent color: Energetic orange (#e67e22) for interactive elements and highlights. 
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif, with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
